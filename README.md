# Kalman-Filter

I develop and implement algorithm to apply Kalman Filtering: a statistical tool to extract core processes or "signals" from a noisy time series. 

Here I consider a specific state space model, however, given the algorithm and full understanding of the literature, the algorithm can be re-adapted easily. So it can be used as a starting point.

DISCLAIMER: The theoretical background is a personal review of "Time Series Analysis" by James D. Hamilton. For more informations about Kalman filtering visit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter).
